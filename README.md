# About

UO Ghost is an Ultima Online server somewhat based on the official Siege Perilous ruleset with some quality of life and user experience improvements on top.

Changes to the standard Siege Perilous ruleset include:

* Disabled ROT. Skill gain works normally.

* Sacred Journey & Recall spells are re-enabled but with a 3x cast delay

* Equipped items are not dropped on death (except Cursed items)

* NPCs teach skills upto 100

* Can select starting city

* Instant Pet Bonding (feed your pet twice)

* A single murder turns your name Red

* Use gold to purchase UO Store items

* Enabled Customizable Keep & Castle & adjusted Housing prices.

Any other differences from Siege Perilous should be eventually corrected to match it. 

If you find any such cases, or any other issues or bugs, please report it via [Discord](https://discord.gg/D5jNKK2U93) so I can prioritize fixing it.
